Legend:
food: Total food per beaker [mg dw beaker-1 d-1]
food_level: Food per beaker and larvae [mg dw larva-1 d-1]
initial: Larval start density per beaker [larvae / 50 cm2]
mort:  Daily mortality rate [% / d]
dead: Dead animals at test end [#/beaker]
duration: Test duration [d]
EmT50: Time to 50% emergence of surviving individuals [d]
eggs: Mean number of eggs per clutch [#], rounded values 


CHECKEN:
Ratio = dead / initial !! (relative mortality)  tote Testende
Mortrel = mort/100 (relative mortality)   Rate
Mortrel	daily mortality (> % mortality per day / 100)
Ratio	dead/initial  (> proportion mortality at the end of the experiment)
